This is inital work on adapting Mojo::JSON for use as a stand-alone module, JSON::Tiny.

This module *may* be relased on CPAN if it turns out ok.  However, until a tagged commit
identifying a CPAN release version number appears, this should not be considered the 
least bit stable.  Everything can (and probably will) change between now and then.
